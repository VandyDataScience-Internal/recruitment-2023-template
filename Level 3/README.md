# ðŸ™Œ Welcome to Level 3 of the 2023 EM/Dev Assessment! ðŸ™Œ

Congratulations on finishing Levels 1 and 2! In Level 3, we will be **evaluating the model** that you have built in Level 2.

## Objective:

Your output for Level 3 should assess the:

    1. Accuracy
    2. Precision 
    3. Recall
    4. F1 score

of your model. Make sure that you are describing the meaning of these metrics in the context of your research question as well as showing your work in calculating these results.

**Bonus Points:** Create a confusion matrix for your model and explain how it relates to accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## You will be graded on:
- Explanation
    - How clearly did you explain your results?
- Code Readability
    - How easy is it to understand your code?

**Note:** Over-explaining is better than under-explaining, leave no words left unsaid!
