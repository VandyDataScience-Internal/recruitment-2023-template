# üôå Welcome to Level 2 of the 2023 EM/Dev Assessment! üôå

By now, you should have a clean dataset from your completion of Level 1. In Levels 2 and 3, you will be extracting insights from this dataset by answering a research question **of your choosing**.

## Your output from Level 2 should:

1. Define all variables of interest (independent variable(s), dependent variable)

2. Forumulate a **relevant research question** (to be answered in your analysis in Level 3)

3. Build a simple **linear** or **logistic** regression model

All of the above components should be contained in a `.py` file. Your final submission should be submitted to XXXX folder.

Your **research question** should address the independent and dependent variables you have chosen to utilize in your model.

## Some examples of well-formulated research questions:

- Is the median price of a house in Nashville related to the number of houses available, median number of days houses are on the market, number of houses with price increases/decreases, and number of houses pending listing?

- Based on different characteristics of exoplanets, can we correctly classify whether an exoplanet is a ‚ÄúSuper Earth‚Äù or ‚ÄúGas Giant‚Äù?

Level 2 is your opportunity to **show what you know** about model building! We have intentionally chosen to keep the requirements flexible to allow you to build your model in a way you are most comfortable/knowledgeable.

## However, when building your model, you must:

- Utilize a random 80/20 train/test split to train the model (note that you will use the test set in Level 3)

- **Comment on every major component of your program.** part of our grading process will be on how thorough and understandable your commenting is 

## Though the following components are not required, excellent submissions will:

- Utilize dimension reduction or principal component analysis before the model is trained

- Normalize all variables of interest

- Check variables of interest for multicollinearity

- Remove insignificant predictors/variables

- Utilize bootstrapping
