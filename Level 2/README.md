# 🏖️ Welcome to Level 2 of the 2023 EM/Dev Assessment! 🏖️

By now, you should have a clean dataset from your completion of Level 1. In Levels 2 and 3, you will be extracting insights from this dataset by answering a research question **of your choosing**.

## Objective:

Your output from Level 2 should:

- Define all variables of interest (independent variable(s), dependent variable)

- Forumulate a **relevant research question** (to be answered in your analysis in Level 3)

- Build a simple **logistic** regression model

All of the above components should be contained in a `.py` file. You will also be submitting your test set as a `.csv` file, which you'll need for Level 3!

Level 2 is your opportunity to **show what you know** about model building! We have intentionally chosen to keep the requirements flexible to allow you to build your model in a way you are most comfortable/knowledgeable.

## Requirements:

You must:

- Utilize a random 80/20 train/test split to train the model (**Hint:** You will use your test set in Level 3!)

- **Comment on every major component of your program.** During our grading process, we will assess how thorough and understandable your commenting is.

## Though the following components are not required, excellent submissions will:

- Utilize dimension reduction or principal component analysis before the model is trained

- Normalize all variables of interest

- Check variables of interest for multicollinearity

- Remove insignificant predictors/variables

- Utilize bootstrapping

## Resources

### On research questions:

Your **research question** should address the independent and dependent variables you have chosen to utilize in your model. Some examples of well-formulated research questions are:

- Can we accurately classify different species of plants based on leaf characteristics and botanical features?

- Based on different characteristics of exoplanets, can we correctly classify whether an exoplanet is a “Super Earth” or “Gas Giant”?
